# 🍫 Cocoa Detection & Classification Models

This project covers two primary tasks: detecting cocoa readiness in images using **YOLOv8** and classifying those images with **EfficientNetB0**. Both models aim to aid in cocoa farming by providing actionable insights into the maturity of cocoa crops.

## 📚 Overview

### 🍃 Task 1: Cocoa Detection with YOLOv8
We use the **YOLOv8 object detection model** to predict cocoa readiness by detecting objects in images. This notebook demonstrates how to train and fine-tune the model for optimal performance.

### 🧠 Task 2: Maize disease Classification with EfficientNetB0
To classify the maize leaves into different stages of readiness, we fine-tuned **EfficientNetB0**, a lightweight yet powerful convolutional neural network, optimized for mobile deployment.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 🍫 YOLOv8 Cocoa Detection

1. **Environment Setup**: Install the required dependencies and ensure access to a GPU for training.
2. **Data Download & Preparation**:
   - **Dataset**: Cocoa image dataset (`cocoa_new.zip`).
   - **Labels**: Convert label annotations into YOLO format for training.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Use the YOLOv8 architecture for object detection.
   - Choose the appropriate model size (`yolov8s.pt`, `yolov8x.pt`, etc.).
4. **Evaluation**: Measure the performance of the trained model and visualize results.
5. **Fine-Tuning (Optional)**: Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size to enhance model performance.

### 🌿 EfficientNetB0 Maize Classification

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution and balance of the dataset. Visualize sample images to understand the data better.
2. **Model Selection**:
   - **EfficientNetB0** was selected due to its high accuracy and small size, making it ideal for mobile deployment.
   - Other architectures like **ResNet50** and **VGG19** were explored but rejected due to their larger size and slower inference times.
3. **Training**:
   - **Feature Extraction**: Train the model on custom cocoa dataset.
   - **Fine-Tuning**: Unfreeze the top layers of the model and train them for higher accuracy on the cocoa dataset.
4. **Callbacks**: Utilize key callbacks like:
   - **Mixed Precision Training**: For faster computation on supported GPUs.
   - **Early Stopping & ReduceLROnPlateau**: To prevent overfitting and help the model converge efficiently.
